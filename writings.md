If I were to do it again, perfectly. 


I would hack squat twice a week and then box squat once a week with a 0.6 m/s velocity. 


I still need to figure out how to make a great box squat pad on the cheap.

Goal: Avoid back pain! Avoid joint pain!

Lesson: If you can feel joint pain during your workout, stop because if that pain can get thru your adrenaline, it's a major ache!
