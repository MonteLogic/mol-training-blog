100% Kosher, protein packed for the Hallachic Lifter.


Goal: Meet your protein goal, two grams of Protein for every kilo you weigh. 

Tuna packs because its easy to eat and affordable. 

With the tuna you'll eat two whole recipe packs and in two hours you'll be hungry again.

Don't get that smoked salmon too expensive and the protein content isn't there.


Just get the packs of Salmon and Tuna.

## Protein Shakes:

This is an isolate Protein shake, also it's Lactose intolerant 

Soylent Protein as well:

Mix these two together, this will taste good and be easy on the stomach.

Soylent has good company practices and their stuff is way better than Huel, which is terrible on the stomach. The sickest, I've ever felt while taking Protein is while taking Huel.

Even if I lived in Israel, I would still have a similar diet, if there were Kosher Fleichiks for a Rotessire Chicken, maybe the prices could compare.


## Don'ts

Don't eat that cooked, Salmon from the Deli, too expensive. 

Sushi isn't ALL that protein dense, not worth it.

It might be a good idea to buy a vegan sushi or a sushi which doesn't have meat and then use that rice and flavoring to flavor up your Tuna packs.
