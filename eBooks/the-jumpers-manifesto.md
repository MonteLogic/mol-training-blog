# The Jumpers Manifesto


# The BLUF: The Bottom Line Up Front. 

We will start this eBook with the required knowledge, how to act on this knowledge to properly will be discussed later on in the eBook.

## Everything you need to know

In here you will know everything you need to get a 100cm (40 inch) vertical.

## The Biggest Misconceptions

## Jumping More is Best. 

Your body will likely not respond to extended jumping sessions in a way which will make the juice worth the squeeze. One of the most high impact things you can do as an athlete is to do an extended jumping sessions. 

The better option is to work in the weight room in a low impact manner and an explosive manner which mimics jumping. Then take this strength gains in the weight room and bring them to the court/field where they will be used to fit the task at hand.

## Olympic Lifts are worth the trouble

Olympic lifts such as Power Cleans, Cleans and Snatches are incredibly hard on your joints. According to one study during of the phases of the Olympic, 'Found forces reaching 6-9 times bodyweight'.

Yeow et al. (2009):

    Documented peak impact forces of 3-5 times bodyweight during landings from a 60cm drop

So nearly twice as bad for your joints as a jump and is NOT the most effective weight room exercise for increasing 


## Try to be like a genetic freak rather than optimizing for YOUR build


How to do it right by following the 'Simple Program'.

+ Box Squat with a quick up motion, should not be struggling, 3x a week.
-- Amongst 

+ Do dumbbell jumps with resistance bands around the shoulders.

+ No more than one jump session a week, no more than 10 jumps. 
-- You're fine with doing your jumping sessions every other week.
-- It's okay, to do mini sessions throughout the week to improve your form.


## The builds for every jumper.

These builds need to be known as every athlete should know their path to improvement.


### Strength based jumper 

If you're reading this, then this is probably you. In this case, you have played sports and still don't have a 100 cm vertical so we know focusing more on elastic based training will not get you the 100 cm vertical.

You will have to follow the 'Simple Program' above to get your jumping goals effectively. 

#### How should strength based jumpers train? 

By following the 'Simple Program'.

On top of this, there are the three drills/plyos I would recommend.

- Knees to Broad jump.
- Hill Sprints 
- Sprint on a manual treadmill, see your peak speed.

Every thing I just recommended can be measured.


#### Sprint on a manual treadmill for peak speed 

You have bad mechanics, so using a manual treadmill forces you to strike underneath your body which is where your foot should be anyways. Also when you are fatigue you still have to have good technique so you won't run anymore thus preventing you from running with bad technique which is terrible for your joints. 


### Elastic based jumper 

A lot of sub-saharan athletes (black people) fall into this category, although many don't.

I myself, half sub-saharan African do not fall into this category. 

By my rough estimation, only 5 percent of athletes can do Elastic based training to get a 1 meter vertical.


#### How Elastic Based Jumpers should train

This is a very difficult build to improve on as naturally jumping often will yield great results. Also, with so few athletes falling into this category its hard to tell the trends of this jumper. More research is needed. 



# Chapter 1:


## Ending the Power Clean hype:


So Power clean is a display of power and strength. It's not a good Builder, power strength. So, Do you understand the reasoning about? This Is to understand that, Okay? So, say, because say that you are powered after, and you want to Lift How times your body weight in, Squat, right?

And you would see that people who jump really high from exting from a standing start. I also have a really good squat. So You wouldn't just so that by that that power lifter is not going to take up jumping. If you want to get his screen half time, squat better Because because jumping it's not a good Builder of squat strength, if it could, it's a display of squash, it's not to builder of it.

It's the same thing because it's a display doesn't all of a certain things. I mean it's good Builder. Power cleaning just shows that you can switch the difference, you could clean pool a lot and be really going to clean pools and be really going to squats. And then you see, naturally going to have power cleans, but power cleans and just how it cleans alone would not.

Really do not increase your squat and your clean pulls as much as if you just clean pulled and squat. Because it's different forces at different, a different moment angles. Okay. The G, the Geos that you spicy, Um, Chrono space, the Chrono space, which is which it exists The moment in time Which exists.

It's an angles, which which is at the movement angles. The certain movement Exist for a reason. Is this person? It does not transfer over necessarily.

## Also, it's not all that explosive 

It's not all that explosive compared to banded jumps BECAUSE you cannot yank the initial part of the Power Clean. When starting the movement you have to go slow-er at first and then speed up. Contrast this with a resistance jump as it is explosive from the start.
