We will start this eBook with the required knowledge, how to act on this knowledge to properly will be discussed later on in the eBook.

## Everything you need to know

In here you will know everything you need to get a 100cm (40 inch) vertical.

The Biggest Misconceptions

## Jumping More is Best. 

Your body will not have incredible adaptations to jumping the vast majority of the time. So the best option is to work in the weight room and then bring that weight room progress into the court/field to bring it into use.



## Olympic Lifts are worth the trouble

## Try to be like a genetic freak rather than optimizing for YOUR build


How to do it right by following the 'Simple Program'.

+ Box Squat with a quick up motion, should not be struggling, 3x a week.
-- Amongst 

+ Do dumbbell jumps with resistance bands around the shoulders.

+ No more than one jump session a week, no more than 10 jumps. 
-- You're fine with doing your jumping sessions every other week.
-- It's okay, to do mini sessions throughout the week to improve your form.


## The builds for every jumper.

These builds need to be known as every athlete should know their path to improvement.


### Strength based jumper 

If you're reading this, then this is probably you. In this case, you have played sports and still don't have a 100 cm vertical so we know focusing more on elastic based training will not get you the 100 cm vertical.

You will have to follow the 'Simple Program' above to get your jumping goals effectively. 


### Elastic based jumper 

A lot of sub-saharan athletes (black people) fall into this category, although many don't.

I myself, half sub-saharan African do not fall into this category. 

By my rough estimation, only 5 percent of athletes can do Elastic based training to get a 1 meter vertical.
